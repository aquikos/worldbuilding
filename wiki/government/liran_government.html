            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Générémós, or, more specifically, the Générémós Liré, is the highest legislative body in the Liran Republic. 
                It functions similarly to a national parliament, though there are some notable differences. 
                It consists of a 144 member legislative body, with 8 parties currently represented (as of the 3660 LY Election).
            </p>
            <h3>Election Procedures</h3>
            <p>
                All Généjés serve three year terms, and are limited to four terms total. 
                Each seat goes up for elections every three years, meaning that in any election,
                it is theoretically possible every single seat to be replaced, though this is at
                the discretion of the parties. 
                
                Instead of voting for individual candidates at a lower level, each state is 
                alotted a certain amount of seats in direct proportion to its population.
                
                To determine the threshold for obtaining a seat, the national population is 
                divided by the 144, the total number of seats. From there, the population of 
                each state is divided by this number, which is rounded to the thousands place. 
                Every state is guaranteed the integer value of the result of this operation. 
                If there are unfilled slots remaining, the state with the highest remainder is 
                given an extra seat first. This continues until every seat has been alotted.
                
                Using the 3660 election as an example, 4 seats remained after each state had 
                been given their baseline amount of seats. From there, State 7 theoretically had
                9.891, so they were the first state to get an "extra" seat. After that, State 3 
                had 18.668 seats, meaning they got the next extra seat.
