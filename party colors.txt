Membership in the Générémós is based on the total population of the country.
There are 144 seats in the Générémós.
Seats are distributed between states based on the total population divided 
by the number of seats in GNMR.

Overflow seats are determined by which state has the highest remainder.
Every state is, however, always guaranteed the full integer value of their seats.

Example: State 1 has 34.6 seats, and State 2 has 28.8 seats. 
State 2 would get the extra seat.
This applies even when the decimal is <0.5.

Seat Distribution(Following most recent census):

    1. 34
    2. 24
    3. 19
    4. 16
    5. 13
    6. 12
    7. 10
    8. 9
    9. 7

From there, parties get candidates based on the statewide election.
If a party gets 50% of the state's votes, they get 50% of the state's seats.
The required percentage to get a seat from any state varies by the amount of seats in that state.
The cutoff in (State 1) is much lower than the cutoff in (State 9) for example.
