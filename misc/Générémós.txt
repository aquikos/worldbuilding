The Générémós, or, more specifically, the Générémós Liré, 
is the highest legislative body in the Liran Republic. 

It consists of a 144 member legislative body, with 8 parties 
currently represented (as of the 3660 LY Election).

All Généjés serve three year terms, and are limited to four terms total. 
Each seat goes up for elections every three years, meaning that in any election,
it is theoretically possible every single seat to be replaced, though this is at
the discretion of the parties. 

Instead of voting for individual candidates at a lower level, each state is 
alotted a certain amount of seats in direct proportion to its population.
To determine the threshold for obtaining a seat, the national population is 
divided by the 144, the total number of seats. From there, the population of 
each state is divided by this number, which is rounded to the thousands place. 
Every state is guaranteed the integer value of the result of this operation. 
If there are unfilled slots remaining, the state with the highest remainder is 
given an extra seat first. This continues until every seat has been alotted.

Using the 3660 election as an example, 4 seats remained after each state had 
been given their baseline amount of seats. From there, State 7 theoretically had
9.891, so they were the first state to get an "extra" seat. After that, State 3 
had 18.668 seats, meaning they got the next extra seat. 

Once every seat has been alotted, elections can occur. Citizens vote for parties 
instead of candidates, and vote with the entire state instead of their locality.
This system may seem bizarre, but it serves to eradicate gerrymandering, and to 
ensure that every citizen's voice can be heard. The sole issue with this system
is that the threshold for a party to obtain a seat in any given state will vary
depending on how populous that state is. For example, in State 1, the most populous state, 
any party is required to have percentage-wise is 2.9% of the vote. In State 9 
however, parties are required to have 14.3% of the vote to get a seat. Upon deeper 
analysis however, this argument falls apart, as every seat still requires approximately 
the same population as any other.
